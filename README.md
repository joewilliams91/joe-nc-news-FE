## Getting Started

In order to view and interact with the code, the instructions below must be followed.

### Prerequisites

The following must be installed on your machine in order to run this project locally:

-Node.js
-Node Package Manager (npm)
-git (a github account is also required)

## Installing

Fork and clone this repository. 

App.js contains the actual app, which comprises the main router, log in/log out functionality and the main state. However, the majority of the app has been broken down into individual, reusable components, which are saved in the src/components directory. The styling, inclusive of media queries, has been written in the App.css file.

In order to generate the required dependencies to use the app, go to your terminal and install:

```
npm install
```

Once this is completed, you will be able to run a local development environment to interact with the app by entering 

```
npm start
```

in your terminal.

Enjoy!
